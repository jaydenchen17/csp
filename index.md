This is me and my partner, Will! Prior to our parternship in the pair project, we've played volleyball together for multiple years.

In my free time, I like to play volleyball, go to the beach, and play video games.

<br>
I've been playing volleyball for about 4 years, inside and outside of school. I'm currently playing for at a volleyball club called Coast, where I get to compete with some of the highest level players. This year is also my third year playing for Del Norte's Varsity team.

Recently I've been pretty hooked on a video game called fortnite. I wish I could say that I was really good at it, but my aim is pretty terrible so I don't win too often.
