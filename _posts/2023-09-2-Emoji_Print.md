```python
from emoji import emojize 
print(emojize(":thumbs_up: Jayden and Will are awesome! :grinning_face:"))
```

    üëç Jayden and Will are Awesome! üòÄ


    The line of code you provided is written in Python and appears to be using a library called "emoji" to work with emojis. Here's an explanation of what this code does:

## Code Explanation

1. `from emoji import emojize`: This line imports a specific function called `emojize` from the "emoji" library. The `emojize` function is used to convert emoji shortcodes (like `:thumbs_up:` and `:grinning_face:`) into their corresponding emoji characters.

2. `print(emojize(":thumbs_up: Jayden and Will are awesome! :grinning_face:"))`: This line calls the `emojize` function with a string as its argument. The string contains emoji shortcodes surrounded by colons, and it also includes some text ("Jayden and Will are awesome!").

   - `:thumbs_up:` is a shortcode for the thumbs-up emoji.
   - `:grinning_face:` is a shortcode for the grinning face emoji.

   The `emojize` function replaces these shortcodes with the actual emoji characters and returns the modified string.

   Finally, the `print` function is used to display the modified string (with emojis) in the console or terminal.

So, when you run this code, it will output a message with emojis in place of the shortcodes, like this:

```
üëç Jayden and Will are awesome! üòÅ
```

It's a simple example of how to use the "emoji" library in Python to add emojis to your text.
