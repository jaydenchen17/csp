## Reflection:
#### Glows
- During our presentation, our site seemed to be pretty engaging and interactive with the visitors. A lot of people liked watching the slot machine's animation and sound, and spent a decent amount of time playing around with our features.

#### Grows
- Login and user balance database was still a bit faulty, and some of our games like blackjack and dice weren't as playful and well made as the slot machine or racetrack.

## Add-ons for Individual Review
Improve upon blackjack game with animations, add sound for racetrack to improve user engagement with functions.

One of the projects that impressed me was the game designed by Rayyan, Jason, and Will's group, I thought it was planned out and designed very interestingly, and it almost felt like an actual game someone might play online or buy.

Another interesting thing was the stock predicting program, which has a lot of cool applications in the real world.

Another thing that I found interesting outside of our class was the photographs taken by the photography classes.
