# Collegeboard 2021 MCQ Practice

## Test Review: 59/70

- We covered a lot of the cirriculum in the team teaches, so it was useful to see a lot of learned material
- A lot of questions were also very basic common sense based, and not very computational
- it was hard to focus throughout the entirity of the test
- some of the wordings were tricky and tripped me up a bit, same with a few of the diagrams
- blox codes??
- the internet versions one tripped me up, i didn't know what it was asking

## Glows & Grows
- learned binary counting! I didn't know how to binary count before, so i got a lot of those wrong in the previous tests, but we got it now!
- Fault tolerance diagrams were still hard to understand, must spend some time reviewing
- unfamiliar vocabulary

## Test Corrections:

Q; Which of the following best describes a direct benefit in using redundant routing on the Internet?

A: Redundancy often allows messages to be sent on the network even if some network devices or connections have failed. If a particular device or connection on the Internet fails, subsequent data will be sent via a different route, if possible. This is supported by redundancy in the network.



Q: Which of the following code segments can be used to draw the figure?

A: code segment starts at the coordinate (1, 0). Inside the loop, a call to drawLine draws a vertical line segment of length len. By increasing xVal by 1 inside the loop, the next line segment will be drawn one position to the right. By increasing len by 1 inside the loop, the next line segment drawn will have its length increased by one. This has the effect of drawing the line segments shown in the figure from left to right.



Q: The following question uses a robot in a grid of squares. The robot is represented by a triangle, which is initially facing right.

A: the first call to botStepper moves the robot forward two squares, rotates it left so that it faces toward the top of the grid, moves it forward two squares, and rotates it right so that it faces right. The code segment then moves the robot forward one square. The second call to botStepper moves the robot forward three squares, rotates it left so that it faces toward the top of the grid, moves it forward three squares, and rotates it right so that it faces right. The robot ends in the gray square.



Q: Which of the following is an example of an attack using a rogue access point?

A: An unauthorized individual gains the ability to view network traffic by connecting to a network router that uses weak or no security measures. A rogue access point is a wireless access point that gives unauthorized access to secure networks. Data sent over public networks can be intercepted, analyzed, and modified. One way that this can happen is through a rogue access point.



Q: Which of the following best explains how symmetric encryption algorithms are typically used?

A: Symmetric encryption uses a single key that should be kept secret. The same key is used for both encryption and decryption of data. Symmetric encryption uses a single key for both encryption and decryption of data. Since the key can be used to unlock the data, it should be kept secret.



Q: A sorted list of numbers contains 128 elements. Which of the following is closest to the maximum number of list elements that can be examined when performing a binary search for a value in the list?

A: 8. The binary search algorithm starts at the middle of the list and repeatedly eliminates half the elements until the desired value is found or all elements have been eliminated. For a list with 128 elements, the list will be cut in half a maximum of 7 times (causing 8 elements to be examined). The list will start with 128 elements, then 64 elements, then 32 elements, then 16 elements, then 8 elements, then 4 elements, then 2 elements, then 1 element.



Q: Which of the following expressions are equivalent to the value of expression as shown in the table?

A: Correct. When input1 and input2 are both true, the expression (input1 AND input2) is true, so NOT (input1 AND input2) will evaluate to false. In all other cases, (input1 AND input2) will evaluate to false, so NOT (input1 AND input2) will evaluate to true.
