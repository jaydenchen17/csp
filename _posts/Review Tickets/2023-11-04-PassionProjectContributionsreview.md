## Week 12
- creating database model, fixed css style
- Model: displays user data in a table format. It retrieves user data, including age, weight, height, activity level, gender, calorie maintenance, and meal plan, from local storage, and dynamically creates rows in the table to display this information. The user data is assumed to be collected and stored through a Flask API and is presented in an organized and user-friendly manner for easy viewing.
