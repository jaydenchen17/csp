## Tasks Completed
- finished Javascript Basics test
- fixed `_notebooks` problem
- started planning and building passion project



## Challenges Faced & Agile Mindset
`_notebooks` fix (4 hours): I had a lot of problems when trying to deploy my "_notebooks" onto my blog, I kept trying to fix errors by pasting my error messages into ChatGPT and then reposting the errors I would get after doing its suggestions. In the end, I gave up on this method since I felt like I was getting nowhere. I deleted my entire vscode directory and reinstalled every package which somehow fixed my make problems with the `_notebooks` . Then I had to spend a long time remaking every single file in my previous repository. BUT NOW MY `_notebooks` WORKS SO LETS GOOOOO!!!
