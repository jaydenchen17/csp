## Challenges Faced & Agile Mindset
- The theme set up was a bit confusing and caused my CSP and Blogs buttons to disappear. I figured out how to get to my "blogs" page with a text link, and spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to create a way to my CSP page but I haven't gotten it yet. Hopefully this problem will be fixed by next week.
